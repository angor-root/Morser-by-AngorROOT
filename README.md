# Morser-by-AngorROOT

Morser-by-AngorROOT is a project that implements an alternative method to Caesar cipher to hide messages at plain sight using Morse code as second encryption factor.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of combining different encryption techniques to create secret messages that can go unnoticed or confuse potential attackers. Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known techniques, but also one of the easiest to break. Morse code is a communication system that uses dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers, but it can also be used to encrypt messages if the meaning of the symbols is changed. By using Morse code as second encryption factor, an extra layer of security is added and frequency analysis is made harder.

## How it works

The project consists of a single Python script that allows encrypting and decrypting messages using the Morser-by-AngorROOT method. The script is a terminal program that does not have any interface.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You do not need any library or installation other than Python itself. The steps are as follows:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/angor-root/Morser-by-AngorROOT.git`
- Enter the project folder: `cd Morser-by-AngorROOT`
- Run the script: `python morser.py`
